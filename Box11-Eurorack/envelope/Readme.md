# Sway

Music feels, moves, breathes. As Matt Wilson might say "Feel the Sway". Without an envelope, we can't. As "the dude" would say, envelopes are like the rug that ties the room together. They shape music.

**Sway** is a very simple Attack/Release [Envelope Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)). It was inspired by a blog post by [Nathan Ramsden](https://synthnerd.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/envelope-circuits-a-simple-ar-design-using-op-amps/) as well as the AR Envelope from [Look Mum No Computer](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/simple-envelope-generator).
